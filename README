This is a sample project to show how AJAX works and to be used in a django project.

It is a 'fixed' copy from Felipe 'chronos' Prenholato  at http://chronosbox.org/blog/jsonresponse-in-django/comment-page-1?lang=en.

I've modified the project to work with django 1.25+ and it's CSRF protection on the ajax POST.  This was done by allowing the view json_get_city to be exempt from the CSRF in django.  This of course is NOT the production way to handle CSRF in django, but it allowed me to learn AJAX and django in a VERY simple way.

Thank you Felipe.
